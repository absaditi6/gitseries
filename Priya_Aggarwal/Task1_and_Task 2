Task 1
Hey..!
Myself Priya Aggarwal, I am currently pursuing BTech in computer science from DIT University dehradun.

1. What are Git and GitHub ? Why Github is so popular in most of the projects? 
Git is a popular control system which is installed and it maintains all your local system and gives you a self contained record if your ongoing programming versions. Best part about Git is that you dont need internet connection to access it and its is free of cost and easy to use. 
GitHub is designed as a Gut repository hosting service. Git repository hosting is an online database that allows you to keep track of your work and shares your Git projects outside the local server. It is popular for open source projects. If the server is failed then the data is not lost since it is saved in your local repository.


2. what are the other platforms similar to Github?
a. GitLab
b. Google cloud source repositories 
c. AWS Code commit 
d. Apache Allura

Task 2

Q1 How git workflow works?
Q2 What are the different stages of a git 
the project as commit, add?
Ans.
1. Working directory - Workspace.
2. Index ie stage
3. Local Repository ie Head
4. Remote Repository
----------------------------------
There is one central repository. 
Each developer clones the repo,
works locally on the code,
Modifies and makes the changes as required
Commit the changes using command commit -a with changes
and push it to the central repository 
for other developers to pull and use in their work.


Q3 Is it possible to do a git commit before git add .
If you have made any changes? Explain why?
Ans. No, because according to the process
first, we have to add the file and then commit changes to it
After making the changes we will add them using "git add ."
and then we can commit it using (commit -a).

Q4 Why is git diff used?
Ans. git diff is used to track the difference between the changes made on a file. This command shows all the
changes which are done. Diff command takes two inputs and 
reflects the differences between them. It is not necessary
that these inputs are files only. 
It can be branches, working trees, commits and more. 

Q5 Can we leave the commit message as blank?
Ans. git commit -a --allow-empty-message -m ""
It is a valid request,commit can have no message at all.
